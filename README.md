# Julie O’Donnell Series

Repository for the Julie O’Donnell contemporary geopolitical techno-thriller / military-intelligence thriller series.

## Current production state

The authoritative production status is [`PROJECT_STATE.yaml`](PROJECT_STATE.yaml). Story canon is controlled by the accepted-manuscript inventory and the accepted Markdown prose.

Current snapshot:

- Active book: Book 1 — title not yet locked
- Target length: **100,000–125,000 words**
- Planning target: **112,500 words**
- Accepted canon: Prologue and Chapters 1–13
- Accepted-manuscript length: **69,830 words**
- Accepted endpoint: **07:46:00 EDT / 17:16:00 IST**, in a public parking garage overlooking Hartwell
- Chapter 13, **The Carrier Stream**: accepted
- Chapter 14 and later prose: not drafted
- Immediate production action: dedicated Chapter 14 mission-lock planning; do not draft Chapter 14 prose

## Source-of-truth hierarchy

1. [`books/book-01/ACCEPTED_MANUSCRIPT.yaml`](books/book-01/ACCEPTED_MANUSCRIPT.yaml) and the accepted files it lists
2. [`books/book-01/control/`](books/book-01/control/) for canon controls and approved production planning
3. [`series/`](series/) for cross-book continuity and recurring-character controls
4. [`books/book-01/drafts/`](books/book-01/drafts/) for unaccepted prose
5. [`PROJECT_STATE.yaml`](PROJECT_STATE.yaml) for production status and navigation
6. [`archive/`](archive/) and Git history for superseded or external-source provenance

Accepted prose outranks every summary, tracker, plan, and draft. Draft prose cannot create canon until it is explicitly promoted in a same-pass acceptance commit.
